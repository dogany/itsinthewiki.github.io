## Permabans:

A player can have their character permaban in any of the following circumstances:

 - They are three-stocked in a 1v1.
 - They are three-stocked by the same person in a free-for-all.

## Rules:

 - During a single session when playing on random maps, if the map is [final destination](fd.md) then a player can elect the match to be the [final game of all time](final_game.md).
 - In a free-for-all, if there are only two players remaining and it is down to one stock, then the player with the higher percentage can ask the other player to become damaged to "even it up". This is entirely optional and the player with the lower percentage can decline, but must give a good reason.
